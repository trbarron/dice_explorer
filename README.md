# Dice Explorer

A 3D dice simulation project built with Godot 4.1 that explores various die shapes and physics-based rolling mechanics.

This is going to allow for quicker iteration of "fun dice"

## Features

- **3D Dice Visualization**
- **Physics-Based Rolling**
- **Multiple Die Shapes (soon)**
- **Camera System**

## Demo

Watch the demo video
- **Demo Video**: [`dice.mp4`](dice.mp4) - Shows the physics-based dice rolling simulation
