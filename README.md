# Dice Explorer

A 3D dice simulation project built with Godot 4.1 that explores various die shapes and physics-based rolling mechanics.

This is going to allow for quicker iteration of "fun dice"

## Features

- **3D Dice Visualization**: View dice from multiple angles with camera controls
- **Physics-Based Rolling**: Realistic dice rolling using Godot's physics engine
- **Multiple Die Shapes**: Explore various polyhedral dice configurations
- **Interactive Controls**: Roll dice with user input and observe results
- **Camera System**: Freely navigate around the dice with intuitive camera controls

## Demo
